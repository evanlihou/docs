# Trust & Security Roadmap for 2020/21

We take a proactive position towards security, and we try to make it part of everything that we do. To ensure that we're on the front foot, we've detailed our roadmap for Trust & Security this year.

## Greater transparency

Transparency and trust go hand in hand, and we'd like for all of our customers, not just those of our cloud products to benefit from understanding how we approach the security of our software and services.

## Compliance

Octopus Deploy is aiming for [ISO/IEC 27001 Certification](https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html).  While we are preparing for that process, here is a [Cloud Security Alliance Self Assessment Questionnaire](../caiq/index.html) to help you to assess our security posture for you own compliance reasons.

If you have feedback on our plans, or would like more details - please see our [2020/21 Trust & Security Roadmap](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Issues/issues/6523), and we'd love to have an open discussion about where we're at and where we're going.
