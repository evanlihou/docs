title: Security Self Assessment Questionnaire (CAIQ - Lite)
description: Read about our security posture in real terms
position: 101
---

We use the Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire Lite (CAIQ-Lite) from the Cloud Security Alliance as a baseline mechanism to express our security posture in real terms and to provide security control transparency.

We've made this publicly available to assist customers in assessing our security posture for their own vendor managment initiatives.
